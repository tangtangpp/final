                                    of 3 to 18 years. The Early Years Foundation stage (age 3 years) is followed by a
                                    sequence of 5 "Key Stages", culminating in the advanced A-level programme (Ages
                                    16-18). By the time students graduate from Shrewsbury Bangkok, they are equipped

                                    (and to thrive) at leading universities and colleges around the world.</p>

                                <p>When children start at Shrewsbury they are placed in year groups based on their age
                                    on 31st August. Progress between Year Groups is usually automatic, although students
                                    may be out of their age group for exceptional reasons. Year Groups are clustered
                                    into Key Stages and a defined curriculum is produced for each Key Stage. Throughout
                                    each Key Stage there are ongoing assessments to monitor and track each child’s
                                    academic progress.</p><br>
                                <p>As students progress through the key stages, they build knowledge in a wide range of
                                    academic subjects, including core English, Mathematics and Science disciplines, and
                                    a variety of humanities and linguistic programmes, including some optional courses.
                                    Traditional subjects are supplemented by a series of bespoke learning programmes,
                                    created especially for Shrewsbury students that focus on their emotional and social
                                    development, as well as academic skills.</p><br>
                                <p>Age-appropriate learning styles and resources are adopted throughout the school, with
                                    play-based learning in our youngest classrooms gradually progressing to more
                                    independent learning styles and complex subject matter. This journey gives students
                                    the opportunity to find their own academic strengths and interests in a variety of
                                    subjects before moving on to the more focused academic content for their selected
                                    IGCSE and A-level programmes, chosen by students with specific university and career
                                    paths in mind.</p><br>
                                <p>In Key Stage 4 (Years 10 and 11), students study a combination of subjects,
                                    culminating in assessed examinations and the attainment of (International) General
                                    Certificate of Secondary Education (IGCSE) qualifications. All students study a
                                    compulsory core of Literacy, Numeracy and Science plus a number of optional
                                    subjects. The IGCSE examinations are a formal assessment of a child’s ability in
                                    each of the subjects they have studied. The route for students wishing to go to
                                    university is to continue into Key Stage 5, also known as Sixth Form, to follow

                                    Curriculum. At the various formal reporting points through each year students are

                                    is assessed against the examination criteria published by the exam boards. Most

                                <p>The role of the Wellbeing Team is to support children in overcoming barriers to
                                    learning and to help these students reach their full potential. These barriers
                                    may be caused by social, emotional or behavioural issues and the Wellbeing Team
                                    will, based on their deep understanding of the student and the pressures they
                                    face both within school and beyond, work with them to help establish a positive

                                    help their children achieve a happy and healthy work-life balance.</p>

                                    identify, assess and support students with special educational needs (SEN).The aim
                                    of the learning support team is to ensure all children with special educational
                                    needs are able to fully access the curriculum. In addition, it provides support for
                                    children who need short term interventions to support academic progression.</p><br>
                                <p>The School works in accordance with the 2015 SEN Code of Practice to adopt a
                                    graduated response to a student’s individual needs. This approach recognises that
                                    SEN are varied in nature and complexity, and, where necessary, we bring an
                                    increasing range of strategies and specialist expertise into effect in order to
                                    support and address the difficulties that a student may be experiencing.</p><br>
                                <p>Even before a student arrives at Shrewsbury, our assessment and admissions procedures
                                    seek to identify any special learning support that a student may need once they are
                                    at the school. A process of continual monitoring and assessment of our current
                                    students also seeks to identify any emerging issues that were not apparent at the
                                    assessment stage, and to devise action plans and additional support measures as
                                    appropriate.</p><br>
                                <p>Our School employs a team of three full time Learning Support specialists, led by the
                                    Director of Learning Support. Should another member of staff express any concern
                                    about a child that may indicate the requirement for specialist assessment and
                                    support, the matter will be referred directly to the SEN team.</p><br>

                                <p>Our EAL specialists work predominantly within a sheltered immersion model, working
                                    alongside class/subject teachers to provide direct support and to co-teach EAL
                                    learners within their normal subject lessons, and also via timetabled English
                                    Language lessons, called English Plus, attended in place of optional foreign
                                    language subject lessons. The English Plus programme seeks to build on previous
                                    knowledge and learning, reinforce the skills taught within the mainstream classroom
                                    and further develop all of the four literacy skills (reading, writing, speaking and
                                    listening).</p>

                                <p>Students are assessed upon entry to the school and at key points throughout the year
                                    in order to determine the level of English language proficiency. Those identified as
                                    needing specialist EAL support are placed on an EAL register, and remain there until
                                    they reach a stage at which teachers feel they will be able to independently access
                                    and respond meaningfully to the curriculum. At this stage they are able to leave the
                                    specialist support of the English Plus programme (albeit with some ‘scaffolding’
                                    still in place).</p><br>
                                <p>In Key Stage 4, the Academic Literacy Programme (ALP) provides an important
                                    linguistic and cognitive stepping stone for students wishing to progress through
                                    their IGCSEs and enter Key Stage 5 (e.g., A-level). A variety of students from
                                    within the school (including those who have English as a First Language) are
                                    eligible to enrol on the ALP, and students who remain in English Plus at the end of
                                    Year 9 are automatically enrolled into the ALP programme as they enter Year 10.</p>

                                <p>The ALP sharpens students’ overall academic literacy skills and focuses on developing
                                    proficiency in critical thinking and discussion, textual analysis and public
                                    speaking by exploring key global issues which are relevant to them. It is designed
                                    as a backwards-planned model that seeks to thread through its units of work the most
                                    important literacy skills of the IGCSE, and A-level curricula (including IELTS and
                                    Reading the World). It also aims to help fully equip students with the life and
                                    study skills that they will need when they leave the school and take their initial
                                    steps in a university setting abroad.</p>

                                    are focussed on providing a set of skills in our students that goes beyond simply
                                    finding and consuming information. How we collate, analyse, interpret and share this

                                    Digital Citizenship program starts from the first day they enter school. Through our
                                    IT and Learning for Life curriculum, students are taught how to make sensible, safe
                                    decisions on their use of technology. This responsibility extends beyond our
                                    students to all members of the Shrewsbury community. Parent information sessions and
                                    workshops relating to E-safety and the use of technology are held regularly to help

                                    opportunity to study the subject further at IGCSE and A Level, if they desire. It is
                                    our intention that students will develop a fundamental understanding of how
                                    computers work, as well as build their logic and problem solving skills through
                                    learning a variety of computer programming languages.</p><br>

                                    school. Our students have access to industry standard Mac technology suites in Art,

                                    home. For the Pre-Prep School we have Tumblebooks which are animated stories
                                    designed to help those learning to read. In year 6 and the Senior School we have
                                    Overdrive a collection of ebooks. Parents can have their own account to access this
                                    collection themselves. Please request an account by emailing the Librarian
