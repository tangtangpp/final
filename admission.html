                                    with a rich co-curricular offering. The average class size across the Key Stage is
                                    normally between 22 and 25 students per class.</p>

                                    normally around 20 students. In many subjects, the number of students per class is
                                    even more favourable.</p>

                                <p>- Each child is provided with a balanced nutritious meal. This means each lunch
                                    always comprises vegetables, carbohydrate and protein components</p><br>
                                <p>- Food is chosen bearing in mind the sort that children like to eat</p><br>
                                <p>- Children with individual dietary requirements (e.g. Halal, vegetarian, Jain) are
                                    catered for</p><br>
                                <p>The food is child-friendly i.e. bite-sized, colourful and tasty, whilst avoiding
                                    artificial preservatives, colouring, flavour enhancers and a high saturated fat
                                    content.</p><br>
                                <p>All lunches are cooked on-site and fresh on the day. Class teachers and assistants
                                    place emphasis upon encouraging each of their children to eat well and to enjoy
                                    mealtimes with one another.</p><br>
                                <p>There are four lunch choices every day. Fruit is served as a dessert everyday and on
                                    Fridays there is ice cream.</p><br>
                                <p>On birthdays, please liaise with the class teacher if you would like to bring in a
                                    cake or pizza for your child. Please do not hand over food or eat snacks in the

                                    quality and appropriateness and recommending improvements. The committee welcomes

                                <p>Home learning refers to work or activities which students are asked to do outside
                                    lesson time either on their own or with parents/carers.
                                </p><br>
                                <p>A well-organised, regular programme of home-learning helps to develop an
                                    understanding of lifelong learning as well as reinforcing learning in the classroom.
                                    Home learning helps to develop a spirit of enquiry, curiosity and investigation in
                                    students. At Shrewsbury International School, home learning is designed to extend
                                    the challenges open to students and to complement – and not impede – a full
                                    programme of extra-curricular opportunities (such as You-Time, Sports, Music, Drama
                                    Excellence).

                                <p>The School’s general approach to home learning is described HERE</p><br>
                                <p>The following guidelines articulate the school’s broad expectations about the amount
                                    of time students might reasonably be expected to spend on home learning and provide
                                    a useful framework for parents. However, the precise amount of time spent on home
                                    learning is much less important than the quality of the tasks set and the way in
                                    which they are planned to support learning.</p>
