                        <br>
                        <p>The values of a Shrewsbury education, inspired by the eminent boarding school in England, are

                            and the highest quality in all we do as staff, will shine through on these pages. I also
                            hope that you gain a sense of the care and compassion that underpins learning and success in

                                        provide a safe and stimulating environment in which to learn. Supported by

                                        student body. As children progress through the Junior School, play-based active

                                        through a series of connected topics or themes that change every half term.
                                        Digital technology is integrated across the curriculum, helping to deliver

                                    <p>All students in Years 7 to 11 study English, Mathematics and Science (either
                                        combined or separate sciences), supplemented by a range of languages, humanities
                                        and creative and performance subjects. As students move up through Senior School
                                        they focus upon subjects of their choice, preparing for the internationally
                                        recognised General Certificate of Secondary Education (IGCSE) courses in Years
                                        10 and 11 and Advanced Level (A Level) in Years 12 and 13.</p>

                                    <p>Students are encouraged and supported to take greater personal responsibility for
                                        their learning. Collaboration, group work and individual assignments are all
                                        used to develop the students’ skills, knowledge and understanding through ever
                                        more independent approaches to learning and discovery.</p>

                                    <p>We are proud to enable our students to develop the skills and attitudes to be
                                        lifelong learners: to think independently, to challenge and discuss rather than
                                        be treated as empty vessels to be filled with facts. We ensure that they have

                                        their applications to the world’s leading universities and to prepare them for
                                        careers in industries that have yet to be invented. This requires our curriculum
                                        to be flexible and to focus upon the higher order skills of collaboration,
                                        communication and creative problem solving.
                                        This education for life extends well beyond the traditional classroom: through

                                        Award, and a carefully constructed “Learning for Life” programme, we encourage
                                        our students to develop leadership skills and become compassionate and
                                        responsible members of the community, willing to question while retaining
                                        respect for traditional values. We challenge them to take calculated risks, to
                                        develop their sense of adventure, to explore new interests and to understand the
                                        place that these have in a balanced and healthy approach to life.</p>

                                    <p>The Sixth Form experience at Shrewsbury International School equips students to
                                        successfully meet their aspirations and longer term objectives both in terms of
                                        their university choices and their career paths, within the context of a highly

                                    <p>As students begin to focus their sights on life beyond the school campus, so the
                                        style of teaching and the levels of independence evolve to reflect the rising
                                        lines of sight. This is also mirrored in the physical environment, as students’
                                        time in school becomes increasingly centred within our purpose-built Sixth Form
                                        centre.</p>

                                    <p>Our aim is to help students prepare for the world beyond school; to encourage
                                        them to take greater responsibility for their personal learning and academic
                                        progress, to nurture assertiveness and leadership and management skills, and to
                                        reflect on their achievements whilst identifying further opportunities for self
                                        development. Most importantly of all, we seek to challenge students so that they
                                        may fully appreciate their own potential, and so that they set goals for
                                        themselves which match the ambition and pioneering spirit that characterizes our
                                        School.</p>

                                        Education advisors, peers and, of course, their parents. We focus on ensuring

                                        highest goals to be achieved, and provide access to the World’s leading
                                        universities; this is synergy in motion.</p>

                                <p>Our school prioritises the wellbeing of our students, placing their needs and
                                    happiness at the centre of everything we do, and everything we ask our students to
                                    do. Our teachers pride themselves on the individual attention and pastoral care that
                                    they provide to students and on the partnerships they develop with parents.</p>

                                <p>We work hard to build a professional yet caring rapport between the students and
                                    staff. In this way all students know that there are adults in the school they can
                                    trust. Every student has a teacher dedicated to overseeing their social, emotional
                                    and academic progress through the school (their class teacher in Junior School, or
                                    their Form Tutor in Senior School).</p>
                                <br>
                                <p>Students can also speak to the School Listening Team whenever they need someone to
                                    talk to about their concerns and worries. The Listening Team, which comprises staff
                                    members from across the school, have been specially trained in Listening skills, and
                                    will listen, advise and support students with their issues. We work in English and
                                    in Thai to allow our Thai students to talk in their first language if they prefer.

                                <p>As an additional level of support for individual students, the School also has a
                                    dedicated Wellbeing Team for both Junior and Senior Schools. The role of the
                                    Wellbeing Team is to support children in overcoming barriers to learning and to help
                                    these students reach their full potential. These barriers may be caused by social,
                                    emotional or behavioural issues and the Wellbeing Team will, based on their deep
                                    understanding of the student and the pressures they face both within school and
                                    beyond, work with them to help establish a positive and productive approach to their
                                    school life.</p>

                                <p>When more complex issues arise we work closely with local services and specialist
                                    providers to ensure that we are offering the most appropriate care and support for
                                    all of our students.</p>

                                <h5>Shrewsbury International School is a warm, friendly and caring school that welcomes
                                    children from all cultures, backgrounds and experiences. It is important to us that
                                    we maintain an ethos where each child can be happy, secure, valued and fulfilled and
                                    their individuality is recognised and respected. The social and emotional well being
                                    of every child is a priority for all our staff. </h5>
                                <br>
                                <p>In our ‘Learning for Life’ programmes we cover personal well-being, health and
                                    relationships. Each month we have a value which underpins assemblies and
                                    discussion/work in class. Linked to this we have a strong ‘student voice’ in the
                                    school – children have responsibilities which they are proud of, for example
                                    becoming a member of the School Council. Children know they can make a difference to
                                    our school community and the wider world.</p>
                                <br>
                                <p>It is important to celebrate the success of all learners. We do this through daily
                                    positive feedback in lessons, recognition in regular ‘Celebration Assemblies’,
                                    feedback in Communication Books to parents, special certificates and events
                                    throughout the year. </p><br>
                                <p>We provide our children with many opportunities to perform, present and listen in a
                                    variety of situations. They are encouraged to participate in assemblies, class
                                    performances and whole school events to share their achievements and talents whilst
                                    developing and strengthening their confidence and self belief. </p><br>
                                <p>The House system at Shrewsbury has been set up to enhance the sense of community
                                    within the school. All children from Year 1 to Year 13 are members of a House. The
                                    many House events unite children from different classes, ages, cultures and
                                    friendship groups to work together. They build vital teamwork skills, pride in
                                    themselves and respect for their peers.
                                    Our children actively support organised charity work, through annual events such as
                                    ‘Charity Week’ or ‘Peace Day’ as well as responding to events that need our care and
                                    full support such as natural disasters. This enables our children to be proactive,
                                    to empathise and to understand the difficulties of others and realise that
                                    collectively we can help to support and rebuild communities.</p><br>
                                <p>Our group of trained staff in the Listening Team are available at a child’s request
                                    to listen to their worries or concerns about matters at home or at school. We have
                                    an excellent team of Learning Mentors who help with the induction of all new
                                    children into the school. They also support any child who may require help to build
                                    their confidence, friendships and emotional well-being.</p>

                                    adults, are our first priority. We expect all members of our community to behave in
                                    accordance with the regulations and educational ethos of the school, and to respect
                                    each other at all times.</p>

                                <p>We seek to build strong partnerships with our parents to ensure that these priorities
                                    are upheld at all times, and to contribute towards these goals as follows:</p>
                                <br>
                                <p>- Safety and Security: all adults should comply with the school’s security
                                    requirements. They should wearing official ID badges at all times whilst on site,
                                    should only use washrooms that are designated for adult use and should only be on
                                    site during lesson time for pre-arranged appointments or organized events. </p><br>
                                <p>- Photography and film: parents re asked to consider the privacy of other people
                                    (especially of other people’s children) and whether they have given their permission
                                    of their picture to be taken or shared.</p><br>
                                <p>- Punctuality: parents are asked to help ensure that children always arrive promptly
                                    for school, and that parents arrive promptly for appointments and to collect
                                    children.</p><br>
                                <p>- Engage with your child’s learning and the community: parents are invited to many
                                    events throughout the year – we hope that you will come along and show an interest
                                    in your own child’s learning and be part of our community.</p><br>
                                <p>- Support children in a respectful way: parents are encouraged to support their
                                    children in performances and at competitive events, but should always be
                                    encouraging, respecting the feelings and efforts of all participants.</p><br>
                                <p>- Support children’s interests and encourage group participation: our aim is to give
                                    children opportunities to explore their own interests, to achieve a healthy balance
                                    between their academic activities and other pursuits, and encourage them to make
                                    positive contributions to the community. We hope that children will find enjoyment
                                    from being part of groups, teams and ensembles where they can share their talents
                                    and inspire those around them</p>
